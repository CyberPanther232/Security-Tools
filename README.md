# 🔍 Cybersecurity Tools & Toolkits

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Tools & Toolkits** – a powerful set of Bash and Python scripts designed for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and security researchers. This repository contains scripts and utilities for network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and various security assessments.

## ⚡ Features
- **Network Scanning**: Tools to gather information regarding ports, services, and ips.
- **Reconnaissance Tools**: Gather detailed information about targets.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify weaknesses in networked systems.
- **Automation**: Easily integrate with existing workflows using modular scripts.
- **Customizable**: Modify and extend functionality based on your needs.
- **Reverse Shells**: Create and manage multiple reverse shell sessions.
- **Command and Control**: Scripts to conduct remote exploitation of machines

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- `nmap`
- `netcat`
- `curl`
- `python3.11`
- `php`

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
These tools and toolkit are intended **strictly for ethical hacking** and **security research**. Unauthorized use against networks you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal. The developers are **not responsible for any misuse** of this software.

## In-Class Disclaimer
This toolkit is not intended to replace learning. If you do not understand what the tools are accomplishing / doing then you should not use them.
The point of these tools are to assist with mundane and repitious tasks without fully replacing the need of understanding core concepts and fundamentals of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

## 🎯 Roadmap
- [ ] Improve scan speed & efficiency
- [ ] Add more recon techniques
- [ ] Integrate OSINT data sources
- [ ] Enhance reporting & visualization
- [ ] Improve effectiveness of learning and task completion
